# GranarMecha

To run GRANAR and MECHA as one in the cloud, go to: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HeymansAdrien/GranarMecha/main
Select the Run_MECHANAR.ipynb and run the example.

The first time you launch this example, it might take a wild to load as the R library has to be install on the cloud environment.
